## About Reset Tech

Reset Tech is a global nonprofit working to defend democracy from digital threats. Their goal is to reset the relationship between media and democracy by tackling misinformation and disinformation with data-driven research. They focus on making their findings accessible to a wide range of audiences, from policymakers to the public, shaping policy and public debate as a trusted voice in today’s digital landscape.

## Objectives and Goal

Reset had a loosely defined brand identity, but as the organization grew and more contributors shaped its design, inconsistencies began to emerge. It became clear that they needed a consistent system to keep their brand identity strong and unified across all platforms.

With a diverse audience that included policymakers, researchers,  as well as the general public, the challenge was ensuring their messaging was visually cohesive yet adaptable to different contexts. Our goal was to create a refined visual identity that resonated with all their audiences while keeping their communications clear and engaging.

## Concept & Workshops

We kicked off the project by bringing key Reset Tech stakeholders together for three collaborative workshops. Using FigJam and post-it notes, we stripped things back to the basics: Who is Reset Tech? What do they stand for? What challenges do they face from a branding perspective?

We asked participants to bring images they felt represented Reset Tech. This was a free-thinking exercise - colors, shapes, moods, concepts - anything that felt aligned with their brand was welcome. From the discussions that followed, three distinct visual style directions emerged: **Modern Minimalist**, **Bauhaus Precision**, and **Digital Collage**.

## The Eureka Moment

At first, choosing just one style seemed impossible. Each direction spoke to a different part of Reset Tech’s work. But instead of forcing a single choice, we took a step back and examined who Reset Tech’s audiences were and what role design played in reaching them.

By defining these audience groups, we realized we didn’t have to pick just one style, we could use all three, strategically adapting them based on who we were speaking to:

**Modern Minimalist**: Clean, refined, and professional - ideal for policymakers and foundations.

**Bauhaus Precision**: Bold, structured, and impactful - best suited for researchers and academic institutions.

**Digital Collage**: Dynamic, artistic, and engaging - perfect for advocacy efforts and the general public.

Instead of a one size fits all approach, Reset Tech’s new visual system became flexible, allowing each audience to engage with their content in the most effective way.

## Guidelines & Application

Once the visual identity was set, we created a comprehensive document detailing the brand guidelines. This wasn’t just about logos and colors, it was a toolkit for the Reset Tech team to maintain consistency across all their work. The guide covered:

- The updated wordmark and logo system

- A refined color palette with accessibility-conscious contrast options

- Typography choices, including Google Fonts alternatives

- Clear rules for applying different visual styles across different audiences

- Whether for digital platforms, printed reports, or data visualizations, these guidelines ensured that Reset Tech’s identity remained strong and consistent.

## Report Layout Design

One of the biggest tests of the new identity was applying it to Reset Tech’s reports. The redesigned ["Profiting from Propaganda"](https://www.reset.tech/resources/profiting-from-propaganda/) and ["Verified Disinformation"](https://www.reset.tech/resources/verified-disinformation-research-report/) reports showed how good design can transform complex analysis into something engaging and digestible.

By incorporating custom illustrations, intuitive layouts, and clear typographic hierarchy, we made sure each report guided the reader effortlessly through the content, while staying true to Reset Tech’s mission and values.

## Key Takeaways

This project wasn’t just about aesthetics, it was about clarity, consistency, and making Reset Tech’s research more impactful. By creating a system that adapts to different audiences while keeping the brand identity strong, Reset Tech is now better positioned to communicate their work effectively and continue shaping critical conversations in the digital space.

## How we helped

**Consistent Brand Presence**: We aligned every visual element to ensure a unified look across digital platforms, printed materials, and data visualizations.

**Progressive Visual Identity**: We created a flexible visual identity that brings together different style directions into one cohesive system for all communications.

**Comprehensive Guidelines**: We created a detailed guidelines book that documents the correct use of logos, colors, and typography across all media.

**Engaging Report Design**: We redesigned PDF reports to be vivid, expressive, and on-brand, featuring engaging imagery and effective data visualizations.

**Data Visualization**: We refined the color palettes and contrast ratios to ensure that data visualizations are both accessible and impactful for all audiences.
