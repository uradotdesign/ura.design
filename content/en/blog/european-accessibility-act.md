In today's digital age where our lives are increasingly intertwined with technology, the importance of digital accessibility has never been clearer. Web accessibility is crucial for ensuring that websites and applications are usable by everyone. It addresses various aspects such as presentation, functionality, navigation, and interaction methods to accommodate users of all abilities.

> **“The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”**\
> Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

This imperative extends beyond ethical considerations; it is also increasingly mandated by law. Legislation such as the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) in the United States establishes standards and guidelines to ensure accessibility across diverse digital platforms, thus safeguarding equal access to digital content for all users.

## European Accessibility Act (EAA)

[The European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202) mandates that companies achieve web accessibility standards by 2025, marking a significant leap towards inclusivity. This innovative legislation prioritizes digital accessibility, extending its reach to cover websites, e-commerce applications, e-books, and even ATMs, ensuring universal access for people with disabilities. This initiative serves a wide range of individuals, including seniors and those experiencing temporary or situational disabilities. As we all may encounter special needs at various points in our lives, this action aims to benefit everyone, ensuring accessibility for all.

The legislative framework aims to enhance the accessibility of European products and services, guaranteeing equal access for people with disabilities across member states. Building upon the [WCAG framework](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), the EAA prioritizes four accessibility principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust [(POUR)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility)—to ensure content accessibility across digital platforms.

The mission is for organizations across various sectors to adopt a [universal design](https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-universal-design-0#:~:text=Universal%20design%20is%20the%20process,%2C%20disabilities%2C%20and%20other%20characteristics.) approach for their products or services, in alignment with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

## How will the European Accessibility Act affect your business?

The European Accessibility Act isn't just another piece of legislation; it's a shift for businesses operating within or targeting the European market. With its introduction of new standards, the EAA ensures that individuals with disabilities have equal access to products and services. But what does this mean for your business?

### Compliance Requirements:

- Applies to businesses operating within the EU or targeting EU audiences.
- Mandates alignment with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for web content.
- Requires meeting accessibility standards for physical products and digital devices intended for the EU market.

### Benefits for Businesses:

- Access to a larger market of 135 million individuals with disabilities in the EU.
- Promotes streamlined cross-border trading and reduced costs.
- Enhances brand reputation through [Corporate Social Responsibility](https://www.ibm.com/topics/corporate-social-responsibility) initiatives.
- Improves user experience and customer satisfaction.
- Encourages inclusive hiring practices, contributing to a diverse and inclusive workplace culture.

### How to become compliant?

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) aims to meet the functional needs of people with disabilities. However, it doesn't provide specific rules on how to achieve this. Instead, it refers to a standard called [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/human-factors-accessibility/en-301-549-v3-the-harmonized-european-standard-for-ict-accessibility). To adhere to the EAA effectively, it's crucial to demonstrate alignment with this standard.

This standard includes the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. with plans to update to WCAG 2.2 in the future. These guidelines provide a solid framework for making digital things accessible within the EU. Organizations are encouraged to aim for compliance at the "AA" level as it covers a wide range of accessibility criteria, including both "A" and "AA" standards.

### Are there exceptions?	

Exceptions are made for organizations that have fewer than 10 employees and an annual revenue under two million euros. Additionally, some products or services might be exempt if adhering to the EAA would constitute an undue burden, specifically if it would substantially alter the nature of the products or services offered. Some examples of exceptions would be certain time-based media and third-party content.

### When is the deadline for complying with the European Accessibility Act?

The EU member states must enforce their accessibility laws by **June 8, 2025**. As this deadline approaches, businesses and projects need to take proactive steps toward compliance. Here are actionable steps to consider:

1. Seek guidance from experienced web accessibility experts to ensure comprehensive compliance tailored to your specific needs.
2. Educate your staff on the best practices for web accessibility to cultivate an inclusive digital environment.
3. Allocate sufficient budget and resources for necessary upgrades aimed at enhancing web accessibility.
4. Stay informed about the ongoing progress of implementing the European Accessibility Act (EAA) to remain adaptable to any regulatory changes or updates.

By taking these proactive measures, your business can navigate the evolving landscape of accessibility regulations with confidence and ensure inclusivity for all users.

Building upon previous iterations, WCAG 2.2 introduces new success criteria to address evolving technological landscapes and the diverse needs of users. These guidelines emphasize mobile accessibility, improved support for users with low vision, and enhanced provisions for users with cognitive and learning disabilities. 
By following WCAG 2.2, organizations can ensure that their digital offerings are inclusive, empowering all individuals to access and interact with content effectively and independently.
