We're excited to announce that Ura Design has joined GitHub's Secure Open Source (SOSS) Fund as an Ecosystem Partner! The SOSS Fund is a program designed to enhance the security and sustainability of open source projects by providing maintainers with financial support, training, and resources.

Selected projects receive direct funding, security-focused education, and hands-on support from GitHub's Security Lab team. 

In our role, we'll share our expertise executing design decisions to help shape the programâ€™s direction and education. By connecting GitHub with our community network, we'll also identify projects in need of support. Our collaboration includes regular check-ins, feedback, and insights aimed at improving user experience and security practices across supported projects.

This partnership aligns with our commitment to make critical infrastructure and end user tools more accessible, secure, and usable. We look forward to engage with supported projects through and beyond the duration of the program.
