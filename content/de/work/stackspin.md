Stackpin offers a spirited and modern online office suite, placing data control squarely in the user's hands. Designed especially for small organizations, it brings an easy-going yet efficient touch to everyday tasks.

We teamed up with Stackpin to refresh their brand identity, their online presence through the website, and enhance the user experience. We offered a new name and a new visual design identity for their brand. For future identity consistency, we also provided a guideline manual, ensuring Stackpin’s visuals remain cohesive in all upcoming activities.

## S as Stack / S as Spin,

As an offspring of Greenhost, we wanted Stackspin's colors to have a harmonious feel with Greenhost's established visual identity. This sense of unity and familiarity is important to us. The redesigned logo carries an ingenious touch, with stacked blocks coming together to form the letter 'S'. It’s a blend of continuity, echoing our roots, and innovation, as we stride into the future.

## Brand Book

After finalizing Stackspin's visual identity, we compiled the brand guidelines book. This manual is key to ensuring that Stackspin's brand and visuals are consistently and accurately represented across all platforms and touchpoints. 

It's a straightforward guide, designed to maintain clarity and cohesion for the brand's portrayal.
