At the heart of OTF's mission lies the profound connection between people and open technology. By empowering communities worldwide, OTF enables individuals to harness the power of technology for meaningful change. By supporting open-source initiatives, OTF fosters collaboration and knowledge-sharing, paving the way for a more connected world.

In essence, OTF's work is not just about technology; it's about the boundless opportunities it creates for people, bridging gaps, and fostering a global community united by the principles of openness and accessibility.

Building upon this connection between technology and community, we designed the new illustrations to 'connect the pixels' between these two essential elements. Each visual element was thoughtfully designed to radiate warmth and inclusivity, offering a welcoming presence on the OTF's website.

## Color System

We started the design process developing a color system, an extended color palette based on OTF's existing brand colors. This thoughtful approach ensures that the new hues seamlessly integrate with OTF's established visual identity. By offering this color system, we not only maintain brand consistency but also introduce new shades that complement the existing colors for different scenarios, such as the illustrations. This allows the illustrations to harmonize effortlessly with OTF's overall branding, creating a unified and inviting visual experience across all platforms. Every illustration stroke and design element, grounded in this extended color system, subtly reinforces OTF's brand identity.

## The People

Human presence is central in OTF’s visual identity. Each composition features people, underlining the idea that technology exists to help us connect. It's a visual reminder that technology serves humanity, not the other way around.We created a variable-based system where each person is customizable in an abstract style. We  used colors from our established palette. This approach ensures alignment with OTF's community, not focusing on specific demographic representations, while representing a diverse and inclusive community.

## Compositions

We offered six different compositions, one for each page of The OTF’s website, serving as a visual narrative that depict the collaboration and shared progress. By seamlessly integrating the intricate tapestry of technology and community, these illustrations create an inviting atmosphere, inviting visitors to explore and participate.
