OpenPGP is used by people worldwide for both privacy (encryption) and security (signing) of messages/files. Many folks try to use the same with secure hardware tokens (say Yubikeys). But, the whole experience of creating a new OpenPGP key properly with various subkey settings and then putting it correctly to a smartcard is not easy even for hardcore command-line users. 

Dcomms is hosted on various Ukrainian servers, offering decentralized and peer-to-peer alternatives for people to use when the internet is down or blocked for any reason. The instructions aim to make it as easy as possible for people to get started using these apps, particularly in Ukraine and Russia, enabling seamless connections with friends and family even in challenging internet environments.

Our goal was to create a tool that can be easily used by anyone to create/update OpenPGP keys and upload them to smartcards using an intuitive Graphical User Interface. We believe that with a distinctive identity, appealing visuals, and an improved user experience, the barrier to using such advanced methods of privacy and security will become much more accessible to people from different backgrounds.

## A Mascot for a Logo

We designed the new logo for Tumpa to enhance its appeal and usability. In our pursuit of making Tumpa a good choice for users, we created a vibrant and approachable visual language, centered around a friendly mascot. This mascot not only adds a touch of charm but also embodies the user-friendly essence of Tumpa. By integrating this delightful character into the brand identity, we are confident that Tumpa will stand out as an accessible and inviting option, making advanced technologies easily approachable for everyone.

## Redesigning Tumpa's Information Architecture

Addressing the challenges posed by the previous prototype's unclear information architecture, we have redesigned Tumpa's interface with a focus on simplicity and user intuition. Information architecture plays a crucial role in guiding users through a platform, ensuring clear navigation and interactions. By reshaping the information and emphasizing intuitive design, our approach aims to prioritize clarity, enhancing overall usability.

## User Interface and User Experience

From there we reorganized the user interface elements, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for users. The application of the new visual identity makes the experience distinctive, more user-friendly and accessibility for everyone.

{{< figure class="no-js" src="/img/work/tumpa-ui.webp" alt="Tumpa User Interface" >}}

We also accounted for scenarios where the key has expired, preventing users from transferring it to their card while still providing access to additional information. We enhanced visibility and accessibility by placing the primary and secondary buttons at the top of the view. 

This adjustment ensures better navigation, especially for users relying on keyboards or screen readers, as the focus order prioritizes these buttons as one of the initial elements they encounter.

{{< figure class="with-js d-block d-lg-none" src="/img/work/tumpa-ux-mobile.svg" alt="Tumpa User Experience" >}}

{{< figure class="no-js d-lg-block d-none" src="/img/work/tumpa-ux.webp" alt="Tumpa User Experience" >}}
{{< figure class="no-js d-block d-lg-none" src="/img/work/tumpa-ux-mobile.webp" alt="Tumpa User Experience" >}}

Due to accessibility considerations, we chose not to disable the "Send Key to Card" button. Instead, we implemented user education, informing them that this action is unavailable when attempted.

{{< figure class="no-js" src="/img/work/tumpa-expired-key.webp" alt="Tumpa Expired key" >}}

Users also have the option to revoke and/or remove their user IDs if they choose to do so. When a user ID is revoked, it notifies other individuals using that key that it is no longer valid and should not be utilized. Since these actions, particularly revoking, are non-reversible and destructive, we added a confirmation dialog to ensure the user is fully aware of the consequences of their actions before proceeding.

## New Landing Page

Following the design of Tumpa's visual identity, we redesigned their landing page, infusing it with the new color scheme and custom illustrations. The result is an approachable and visually cohesive experience that guides users through the content. The combination of vibrant colors and intuitive illustrations creates an inviting atmosphere, enhancing user engagement and reflecting Tumpaâ€™s ethos.
