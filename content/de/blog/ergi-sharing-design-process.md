Right before the end of 2023, I spoke with our Visual Design Lead Ergi. Anything from unforgettable logos, to compelling visual storytelling to creating a unique visual identity, you can be sure it bears Ergi’s handwriting. He has been with Ura for more than 5 years. In the following conversation, he introduces us to his creative process, sheds light onto the myths of logo design, and what design collaboration looks like. Finally, he explains why we at Ura should integrate the Open Source Community more systematically into that process.

## Creating Something out of Nothing

**Marit**: Let’s warm up thinking about the creative process with a broader question. Do you find yourself in moments where you explore something out of nothing, and how does that work for you?

**Ergi**: For me, it's tough to start from nothing. I don't think it's a good start to start working when you have nothing to work with, no material, no requirements and no first ideas.

**Marit**: What would you do then?

**Ergi**: In this case, I would gather a lot of materials, and maybe speak with the people who are responsible for the project, especially if we are working with a client. If it's your own project, it's a different process.
That's why for me it's easier to work with a client. I have a point to start from. So in this case the process would start with asking as many questions as you can. You can conduct this through a video call, or we at Ura now use something we call the Visual Identity Form. This would be a questionnaire where we list all the questions that we have, send it to the client, and they fill it out. Based on their answers, we gather all the information and build a creative brief based on what we have.

**Marit**: Besides the creative brief that you described, what other materials do you gather to start off from something?

**Ergi**: Sometimes, it’s a good idea to ask for examples that they visually like or to mention similar initiatives so you can get a good idea of what they're wishing from you since usually, it's very hard to explain with words what you really want. After that, you start researching and building mood boards. You can also look for other projects that may fit the profile. In the case of visual design, you will gather a few images. It's hard to know where to stop.

## From Gathering to Preparing to Trying Out

**Marit**: How do you know when to stop gathering?

**Ergi**: You should stop somewhere. You recognise patterns when you have worked with clients for many years. You know that sometimes you need to stop the exploration phase because your hours are limited.
When I started working in this field, I used to spend a lot of time just researching, creating different mood boards, and designing different directions that may not work. But I needed to see them until the end, designing more and more logos within one direction, only to find out that the direction did not work. But now with the experience, I understand when one direction is not a good direction to explore further, and I directly change it and start exploring something else.

**Marit**: How does this moment of knowing and changing, or abandoning feel for you? Can you describe that?

**Ergi**: Abandoning in this context is a part of the design process. I’m not sure if I can describe it, but it is there when you're designing or creating, regardless if it is music or illustrations because I have explored all of them. You just get lost in there. You are working on something, you realize that you don't like it, then maybe you take something from here, duplicate it, and you explore more, you change stuff.
It is as if it was in the back of your head, like all the creative thinking. Of course, I would like to explore a lot more all the time, but the role of experience of course is to take a limited budget into account, and it helps to understand and to abandon what you're doing.
Somehow, this part of the process is not motivational in a way. Depending on the allocated time with certain projects, we don't explore very deeply.
Flows and Limits

**Marit**: The flow that you describe, how do you manage to develop it while being careful not to spend too much time, and to respect the budget? How do you negotiate with yourself?

**Ergi**: It’s difficult to be precise on that, of course. But one thing that helps is keeping this in mind when you start exploring. You see that there might be some different design paths and you know that some of these paths will take more time to explore than the others. So you start being selective and focus on the directions that are more simple, and easy to explore.
For example, when you're designing a logo, you think of three to five concepts that may be related to the project. These concepts will be translated into visual elements that can be part of the logo. For new initiatives, it is suggested that the logo says something about the project, literally or in an abstract way. So you gather these elements and start to explore different visual combinations of them, always with the intent to design a logo that works.

## What makes a good logo

**Marit**: What makes a logo a logo actually?

**Ergi**: When designing a logo, there are two sides to accommodate: the creative part, and the functional part. The functional part is what really, really matters. It's fundamentals. Regarding the creativity and the creative concepts behind them, sometimes they're not very creative, or not very original. Sometimes you hit the jackpot. You might have a combination of elements in such a way, and you create something that's very original. And you start looking, has somebody created this logo before?

**Marit**: So I'm wondering if I understood you well regarding the **functional aspects** of the logo. Would it be correct to say that you start with the functional aspects of the logo first?

**Ergi**: I think every logo should be **scalable, flexible** and **recognisable**. Usually, when a logo is original, it is recognisable. With that in mind, you can design logos that “work”. A logo doesn’t need to be „wow“, it just needs to work as a logo. I think this is the most important part because often they are mistaken with art. It's not art. It should be functional and achieve its goal, which is to visually represent a project.

## Logos and the Open Source Community

**Ergi**: In the Open Source Community, there is the problem that there are very few people with design skills or the ability to financially support an agency to design their visual identity. Most projects start with only one person and they do the logo by themselves or with the help of someone from the community. And they want logos to be very descriptive. I understand that it's a good idea to be descriptive because you need to give users some information about what it is about. I have seen logos that have too many visual elements, then they become cluttered and fail the logo principles. At that point, it becomes an illustration.

## Making Cocktails of Symbols

**Marit**: Coming back to the elements of the logo that symbolizes the function of the software product. Who decides which elements should make it into the logo, and which not?

**Ergi**: Sometimes the client might mention it in the very first conversation, but most likely they are concepts. They want to include concepts. It's our duty to translate them into visual elements. For example, it might be concepts like “Humans“, „Technology“, and „Sustainability“. Then we translate them into visual language, looking for all the symbols that have been used for these words. For example, when we talk about sustainability or recycling, we know what elements are usually used to translate these concepts. So we start from there. Of course, I would not like to use them as they are. It wouldn't make the logo very original. But you can get one shape from a symbol, one color from the other, and you can translate the combination of these concepts into an original logo icon. You start merging, making cocktails of symbols to see what fits and what goes well.

## Trying out Directions, and Sending Proposals

**Marit**: So you prepare yourself to work on a logo by looking at existing representations for „Sustainability“ or „Recycling“ to inspire yourself, then make something new, and with growing experience, this exploration has become much shorter?

**Ergi**: Correct.

**Marit**: What happens then?

**Ergi**: At Ura, We have a basic process that we can adapt based on what the project needs. After gathering information, building a creative brief, exploring, building mood boards, and exploring logos, we usually propose between three to five designs. We try to be selective, that is, even if we have developed more concepts, we still send out three that we like and we think work best. We have had this problem before where we would send logo directions, including one that didn't work quite well, but it was a direction somehow, and then the client chose exactly that one. We would have to convince the client about another option then. So after proposing the first logo directions, we usually need to do a second iteration and continue exploring again but now we are a bit more focused on the direction that the client has already selected.
So this would be the ideal case. For example, we send three directions, and we call them directions because they're actually paths. They do work as logo proposals but with the probability to make changes and offer more iterations later, working as a filter which helps us on what style to focus. So there are more specific proposals inside a chosen direction, like branches. You can create more branches based on that.

**Marit**: So once you are not questioning the whole direction anymore, what does that mean for your working process?

**Ergi**: Usually there are elements like the colors, the shapes, maybe you perfect it a little bit more, change the typography, etc. I remember designing a logo for a browser concerned with censorship: We sent five logo proposals and they selected two as their favorites. So after that, we sent two for each, so four other proposals, based on these two directions. One direction had the shape and the element inside, the other direction didn't have the shape. So like small differences just to see what works better.

## Retrieving Client Feedback

**Marit**: When you send out directions or proposals, do you also consult the client as to why a proposal would work better than another one? Are you making a design critique of your own creation, making that transparent to the client so that they can make more informed decisions?

**Ergi**: We don't have a fixed approach for that. When presented in a meeting, we usually explain the proposals to the client and the thought process behind them. When we send our visual identity proposals, the template that we have designed for the presentation includes a logo breakdown for each proposal that would describe the elements that have been used in this logo.

## Retrieving Community Feedback

**Marit**: By now, we went through your creation process of the visual design. What is still missing from your perspective?

**Ergi**: For final logo decisions, we should consider involving the open-source community more systematically. We have done it before sporadically. For example, for the new Onion Share logo, we should do that.

**Marit**: Do you know how we should do that?

**Ergi**: Where do we find this community? And how do we gather their feedback? I've never done it personally. I've never gathered information from a community, and I don't know how it works. Maybe it would be something very natural.
For example, you create a post and you see their reactions. Maybe there should be a test like it is done for User Tests. Like with any other feature or product idea, there are several ways of getting feedback and the question is to find the right users and apply the right method.

We should consider that even when we are formulating the tasks that we will list in an application to the Open Technology Fund. We should consider that extra step. I think, and we should not underestimate the visual design because sometimes it seems to be very unpredictable.

In that sense, the feedback of the community could become part of the material that constitutes the gathering and preparation step of the design process. I think it is the way that it should be done in fact when we talk about open source design projects.

Then it is truly open-source design.

**Marit**: Thank you very much for this insightful conversation, Ergi.
