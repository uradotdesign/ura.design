Over our years immersed in the open source community, we’ve forged invaluable relationships. This spans both commercial and non-profit open source projects. Many of these collaborations entailed continuous projects that often involved paperwork and, for organizations, even procurement processes.

From our interactions, a recurring sentiment emerged: many clients expressed a preference for a more structured engagement with us. They desired a support contract model, where they could allocate a set monthly budget. In return, we’d reserve dedicated time for them consistently each month.

Navigating the digital landscape is no easy task, especially for organizations in the open source and non-profit sectors. These sectors have unique challenges that can sometimes feel overwhelming. With this understanding, we’re delighted to introduce Bridgebeam, a SaaS-like design subscription site powered by Ura.
