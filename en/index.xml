      <description>Over our years immersed in the open source community, we’ve forged invaluable relationships. This spans both commercial and non-profit open source projects. Many of these collaborations entailed continuous projects that often involved paperwork and, for organizations, even procurement processes.&#xA;From our interactions, a recurring sentiment emerged: many clients expressed a preference for a more structured engagement with us. They desired a support contract model, where they could allocate a set monthly budget.</description>

      <description>Ura has been working with Briar since 2018, namely on various UX features such as adding contacts remotely, SD card message sync, image attachments, mailbox features and more.&#xA;As we have worked on various short engagements throughout the years which required certain educational or illustrative images, the image coherency of icons and illustrations deteriorated as Briar received more and more features and visual assets became an afterthought.&#xA;This resulted in over 30 illustrations looking vastly different from each other and desperately in need for unification.</description>

HTTPS Everywhere makes it possible to block and unblock all non-HTTPS browser connections with one click.&#xA;In an effort to improve the user experience, we worked with the EFF team to reimagine HTTPS Everywhere.</description>

      <description>At Ura we have been constantly working with open source projects to get their branding up to speed. While we love working on fully fledged visual identities for projects, we are aware that some projects simply need a logo to get started and focus on the actual software features. This motivated us to build Logobridge, an open source collection of public domain logos anyone can use for their projects for free: https://logobridge.</description>

They support people by providing funding, education, mentorship, design support, research, testing, and a community for collaboration.&#xA;This was the first time Underexposed took place in the form of a residency.</description>

      <description>Back when Ura was founded in 2016 we only had a small landing page and a Patreon to help fund the time we help Open Source projects. It was very little but the thought that people would support us kept us fueled. During that time we were also approached by I2P for helping them with updating their website and some branding. We resided to simplify the logo to something which would offer more flexibility and be already an improvement of the former logo.</description>

The community writes articles, runs a job board, puts on events, provides resources, and presents talks targeted at developers and designers interested in working and designing in Open Source.</description>

      <description>Since early on, we had a special connection with Thunderbird. While many users moved to web-based mail clients, we always preferred using a single mail client to manage our mail and calendar. In fact, in the early days our founder Elio helped redesign the Thunderbird Conversations add-on and even now our email infrastructure is powered by ProtonMail and ProtonMail Bridge via Thunderbird.&#xA;Unfortunately, Mozilla moving away from Thunderbird created technical and design debt throughout the past years, resulting in a wider gap between Firefox and Thunderbird.</description>

      <description>Oftentimes we witness the results of elitist practices upon users, usually worded in the form of the acronym RTFM or &amp;ldquo;Read The Freaking Manual&amp;rdquo;. User manuals have their place, but up to which point can we expect users to learn by reading instead of doing?&#xA;A similar stigma often appears in Free Software / Open Source projects as well. The alternative &amp;ldquo;Read the Documentation&amp;rdquo; certainly would ensure that people would give a little more effort before repeating questions.</description>

      <description>Quite some time has passed since we first got in touch with the Open Source Design community. While being an utopian idea in the beginning, it has become clear to us that bringing Open Source values to Design and vice versa requires more of a culture shift than anything else. Having this mantra in mind, we tried to apply these principles in all communities we were part of. While Ura has a global audience, we care about our roots as well, which are in Tirana, Albania.</description>

Just like at CCC, we strive to be at events which promote collaborative projects and initiatives. In addition to that, three members of the team were there as Mozilla Tech Speakers. It can be said that many of us wear various hats at the same time.</description>

In the first days we thought that this was enough to change the quality of visual communication. This perception changed gradually after discussions with graphic designers that are doing their first step in this field.</description>
